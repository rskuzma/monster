      "Want to be a core member of the next revolution in online payments? Payments on the internet today look largely like they did fifteen years ago, in contrast to every other part of the web. At Amazon we have figured out how to build a massively-scalable payment eco-system. Now we want to bring it to the world and launch the next set of big innovations in the industry! Amazon Payments' vision is that every Amazon customer will pay with Amazon Payments every time and every place s/he transacts anywhere online. You will play a leading role in building the only 1 billion plus on-boarding, account management, and monitoring platform in the world. Our product will seamlessly recognize a billion customers across online and offline channels, mobile, and other connected devices (Omni-channel) recognize their needs, tailor Amazon services to their preferences, and identify patterns of customer behavior to reward and rebuke. To succeed, we will need to identify hundreds of thousands of typologies/behavioral patterns for several billions of customers by mining data collected at point of sales, and every device they used to consume Amazon services. You will be working with data from 1 out of 7 people in the world, 1 out of 3 people on the internet, today. To make this happen, suspicious activity detection technology needs to be re-defined and scaled to a whole other dimension, allowing us to separate the good from the evil effectively, which is where you come into the picture!Machine learning and data science present a powerful solution to the current problems facing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programs. As a machine learning scientist, you will leverage your machine learning and advanced data science skills to identify, detect, and prevent Anti-Money Laundering modus operandi. This includes building behavior-centric models for seller and buyer activity, classifying transaction activity of customers with similar traits (business type, geographic location, age, etc.), clustering customers with similar transactions behavior, and identifying outliers from the crowd. You will also build systems that leverage unique storage systems such as graph database technologies, and build a sophisticated rules management platform for our compliance and risk evaluations.At the end of the day, we make the world a better place by preventing unlawful activity on our platform, and making it easier for normal sellers and buyers to safely and seamlessly conduct their business. Join us in building platforms and products to protect Amazon and its customers by keeping unlawful activity off Amazon, and then scale your solutions to the exponential growth of Amazon. We are successful when we enable Amazon internal and external customers and sellers to more frictionlessly use our products including Selling on Amazon, Login & Pay with Amazon, Mechanical Turk, and AWS products. And the list is only increasing! The successful candidate will look at the big picture from both a business and technical perspective, and lead the organization in developing new software to support Amazon businesses.Some things you might like about our team that’s different from others: Our future is machine learning in native AWS. Our team is growing substantially over 2016 and 2017. It’s still Day 1, and you have an opportunity to be involved in establishing a platform team that is critical to existing businesses and an enabler for new product launches. We have extremely low operations burden, no legacy software, all of which enables us to focus on strategy and building software. As a leader in our space, you get to put on the strategic hat, work across orgs and consult with the best ML leaders in the world across the company to determine our path forward, and re-define how the Anti-Money Laundering problem is solved. Last but not least, we operate like a startup, and you get to step up as a more senior leader quickly if you chose to!AML is just one machine learning application area. With the exponential Amazon business growth, we will have new lands to explore, which means unlimited career growth for you!Technical Responsibilities:Lead the development and implementation of machine learning models and algorithms to detect malicious and suspicious buyer and seller behaviorApplies advanced mathematical theory, statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to improve existing approaches and designs.Designs solutions for complex business problems with a company-wide perspective in mind, leveraging quantitative methods that also keep operational burden at a minimum.Executes large-scale or highly complex projects and plays a role in key aspects of a strategic project.Establishing scalable, efficient, automated processes for large scale data analyses, model development, model validation and model implementation.Plan, design, execute and measure controlled experiments to understand impact of our actions on buyers and sellers within the Amazon Marketplace.Reviews model performance during implementation, at a system level, identifying opportunities for improvement.Analyze and understand large amounts of Amazon’s historical business data for specific instances of risk or broader risk trends.Perform ad hoc data retrieval and analysis using relational databases or other data management systems.Leadership Responsibilities:Understand high-level business objectives and continually align work with those objectives to meet needs of business (ROI, cost-benefit analysis).Mentor and coach analytics team membersEffectively advocate technical solutions to business stakeholders, engineering teams, as well as executive level decision makers.Design strategies for effective use of model output.Maintain a culture of innovation via rapid prototyping and research to leverage new data sources and techniques.Leads report-writing efforts to communicate analysis and proposed solutions to stakeholders.Amazon is an equal opportunity employer.
